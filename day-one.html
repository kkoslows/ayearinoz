      		<h2>Jessica Walsh</h2>
      		<p><strong>Did you see Timothy today?<br />
</strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>What did y’all do together?<br />
</strong>We had our first date at The Fat Radish in the Lower East Side. They have the best roasted carrots, and my favorite tequila jalapeño drink.</p>
<p><strong>Did anything interesting happen?<br />
</strong>Before the date, Tim had a messenger deliver a cute note: &#8220;Me + You x 40. Ready?&#8221;</p>
<p><a class="lbx" href="http://fortydaysofdating.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/TimNote2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-675" alt="TimNote2" src="http://fortydaysofdating.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/TimNote2-700x574.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Truthfully, I am quite nervous. However, I know that when an opportunity scares me, I must go for it. I don&#8217;t like having fears. No matter what the outcome, it will certainly be an interesting experience. Hopefully we can have some fun along the way, too.</p>
<p><strong>Did you learn anything new about Timothy?<br />
</strong>We discussed Tim&#8217;s relationship patterns, and how he’s in a constant cycle between three women. There is always one girl he&#8217;s really excited about that he&#8217;s trying to go out with, a second girl he&#8217;s been seeing for a few weeks and is getting tired of, and a third girl he&#8217;s been seeing a while and is getting ready to break up with.</p>
<p><a class="lbx" href="http://fortydaysofdating.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/16.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-761" alt="1" src="http://fortydaysofdating.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/16-700x614.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>He told me that when his mother got pregnant, his father made her choose between keeping the child or staying with him. It seems to me his dating style could result from this. He breaks off relationships before they get too serious to avoid the risk of abandonment. He&#8217;s built up this reputation for himself as &#8220;the player,” but I see past the façade. He&#8217;s been a great friend, and I know he&#8217;s a very kind person. We all have our issues and cope with life differently. Sometimes I think the &#8220;normal&#8221; people are just people you don&#8217;t know well enough yet.</p>
<p><strong>Did you learn anything new about yourself?<strong><br />
</strong></strong>We talked about relationships with parents, and how many girls have &#8220;daddy issues.&#8221; I don&#8217;t have dad issues. I heart my dad!</p>
<p>My parents married at a young age, and have a successful marriage. I wonder if that is part of the reason I am always trying to find the right person and why I feel like such failure when a relationship doesn&#8217;t work out.</p>
<p><strong>How do you feel about this relationship/project right now?<strong><br />
</strong></strong>I think I have have some sort of guard up preventing myself from seeing Tim as anything more than a very close friend. As his relationship patterns are the opposite of mine, a part of me fears that if we were to really date, one of us might wind up getting hurt. I don&#8217;t want to ruin our friendship. We also have a tight group of friends, and I think we are both afraid to compromise that.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything that you want to do differently?</strong><br />
In my work and other aspects of life, I am uncomfortable with comfortable. But when it comes to relationships, I do seek secure relationships that are clearly defined. I know I should relax and open myself up to vulnerability, so I can learn to enjoy dating more in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Additional comments?<br />
</strong>Tim insisted on being a gentleman and paying for dinner, which was very sweet of him, but I want to get the next one.</p>

      		<h2>HOLT</h2>
      		<p><strong>You made it! What’s your first reaction?<br />
</strong>On the plane during the descent my reaction was wow, it’s beautiful.  The seaside cliffs and beaches and just a sprawling yet still somewhat quant city.  Then our cab driver is very talkative but also very friendly (which an American expat to Australia had told us many people here were, possibly even friendly to a fault).  The apartment is quite lovely as well, in a beautiful neighborhood full of British-style townhouses.</p>
<p><strong>What did you do today?<br />
</strong>Immediately found the closest coffee shop to the apartment while waiting for the property manager to let us in.  I just left Kristin on the corner of the house with all our luggage while I went to go get coffee.  Priorities.</p>
<p><a class="lbx" href="http://fortydaysofdating.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/timpackage.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-678" alt="timpackage" src="http://fortydaysofdating.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/timpackage-700x563.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Anything particularly different about SYD than from NYC?<br />
</strong>The drive from the airport to the apartment was much shorter than I was expecting.  It was probably 20 minutes, so not like the long haul you have to make to get out to JFK from Manhattan.  The Paddington neighborhood feels a bit like Brooklyn, though it was extra quiet when we arrived.  I think the quietness was due to us arriving the morning of a weekday so I guess most people in Paddington had left for work already.  Also, we’d been warned that the city might be quiet (except at bars) that day because it was the day of the Melbourne cup horse race.  At the coffee shop at the end of our street, I felt quite at home.  Even though there’s not really drip coffee here, you can get pretty close with their version of a strong Americano, the “long black”.</p>

<p><strong>Did you handle the jet lag well?<br />
</strong>Decently.  Didn’t have any falling asleep in the middle of the day episodes, but definitely went to bed early the first couple of nights.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Comments?<br />
</strong>Too soon to say.</p>
