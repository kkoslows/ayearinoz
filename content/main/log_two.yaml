desc: Log Two - Holt goes to work and Kristin goes to the beach.
questions:
  How did you take your coffee this morning?:
    holt: "I made an aeropress with the Rushcutter's blend (from Rushcutter's just up the street). I then had a long black of allpress espresso that Viktor brought in (not sure from what café), and later met Kristin at Cabrito in the CBD for an afternoon long black."
    kristin: "Holt made an aeropress, so a 'long black'. We sat out on the front balcony and listened to the morning sounds of the neighborhood. As we sipped our coffee, two wild cockatoos landed in a nearby tree. We watched them raise their shockingly yellow headdresses and they then proceeded to pomp and circumstance from branch to branch with their headdresses held proudly. Our NYC pigeons aren't nearly as interesting and the NYC hawks are hard to spot, so that was quite interesting to watch while having brekkie."
  What did you do today?:
    kristin: "I walked along the coast Bondi Beach to Bronte Beach.
As I walked along the little path that snaked around cliffs and beaches, art installations would come in and out of focus. Some of the installations tried to change the way the viewer engaged with the coastline, or re-framed your point of view. It was an interesting walk.<br /><br />
There's an amazing looking pool at Bondi Beach called 'Icebergs.' I must swim here. It is set into a cliff overlooking the beach and seems to use natural water, or at least, the sea spay comes up and washes into the pool with every roll of the ocean. It looks like heaven.

    holt: "Took the bus to Bree, the Palantir Sydney office! Small office (4 desks and a small conference room), but central location in the CBD of Sydney with a great view overlooking the opera house, the bay and the royal botanic gardens. Also over in either Woolloomooloo bay or Elizabeth bay there's some kind of weird aircraft carrier thingie, which is apparently meant for amphibious troop landings and helicopters, i.e. it looks like an aircraft carrier but isn't long enough to be one."
  Describe an interesting creature or human you saw.:
    holt: "I saw several Australian white ibis birds in the park at lunch, and several cockatoos outside of the balcony at the apartment in the morning (both the cockatoos and the ibis seem fairly common, and of course the magpies are as well)."
    kristin: "On my way to Bondi Beach, I popped into a beautiful airy store called <i><a href='http://www.girlandgraaf.com.au/'>Girl and Graaf</a></i>. The owners, Lauren and Simon have curated a wonderfully bright collection of textiles, stationary, and objects that are well crafted and deeply connected to the culture and place in which they are produced. I was drawn to a lovely looking book about produce from New South Wales so I could learn about the foods, purveyors, and restaurants that specialize in procuring and serving local ingredients.

As I made moves to purchase my guide to local food, Lauren struck up a conversation with me (as Australians tend to genuinely want to make small talk) about Holt and my plan to live in AU for a year as well as places we'd like to visit while here. I mentioned I'd love to visit Bali and Lauren offered a bit of advice on places that were 'nice' and places that were 'gross'. She wrote it down on her store's postcard and offered it to me.<br /><br />
Seminyak – nice<br />Ubud – nice<br />Kuta/Legian – gross<br />Nusa Dua – boring<br />

  Any divine food or beverage experiences?:
    holt: "Coffee is just really good here. Lunch was also excellent, if a bit larger than we were expecting. I got one of the Japanese “lunch box” lunches that had excellent tonkatsu, sashimi and miso soup."
    kristin: "I had pour over from Cabrito Coffee Roasters in the Central Business District (CBD), but it wasn't what I expected. It was light and not nearly as forceful or caffeinated as I expected a pour over to be. I will be sticking to ordering 'long blacks' for my afternoon coffee fix."
  Additional comments?:
    kristin: "I must swim in that pool!"
    holt: "I got a first-hand experience in how expensive things are here by buying running shoes at a sports store for literally $30 more than they would have been in NY. I know this, because we looked up the exact shoe online later, so I'm not exaggerating."
