questions:
  What have you been up to?:
    holt: "We’ve wanted to try surfing in Australia, so we signed up for lessons.  It’s not that we couldn’t have surfed in NY ever, it’s just that here the water is bluer, beaches are closer, surfing is more of “a thing” or something made us want to try it here.  In any case, we decided that AU was the place to start, and December was a good time.  <br /><br />

However, the day of our lesson, we were twice foiled by weather.  First, we were supposed to have the lessons over on Manly beach, but they were cancelled due to high wind (the beach was closed).  Then instead, we tried to do a beach walk from “the spit” to Manly beach, but started getting rained on near the beginning and decided to admit defeat for the beach that day.  At least it was nice and sunny for part of the day.<br /><br />

Most recently, I attended some company off-sites in Canberra as well as the company’s Asia-Pacific holiday party in Sydney.  Two years ago was the last full company holiday party, so last year was the first time we had a party per office, or in the case of smaller offices, party per region.  So, this was the event for our Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Tokyo offices!  We had lunch at coogee beach in Sydney and had some beach time (though it was very windy again, like our surfing day!).  At the actual party, I had a good time, the venue was overlooking the Sydney bay and a marina in point piper.  The food was good, and it was cool seeing people from around the region like that.<br /><br />"
    kristin: "Christmas is set in the summer holidays here, as such, businesses are holding their holiday parties, schools are letting out, and everyone’s mind is on vacationing.<br /><br />

I met with several new friends that I have met through running in Centennial Park (see my hand drawn map of my Sydney) for holiday drinks at ‘The Local.’ To add some festive cheer, I brought along a holiday wreath I made from my broken-upon-arrival-to-Australia bike wheel. <p><a class='lbx' href='images/log_eight/kristin_wheelwreath.jpg'><img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-1478' src='images/log_eight/kristin_wheelwreath.jpg' /></a></p>
My wreath was seen as crafty and in keeping with the ‘she’s from NY’ identifier that glows over my head which seems to mentally equate as ‘from Brooklyn’ in the Brooklyn craftycool-brand proliferation across the globe. Drinks were fun and confusing since I can hardly understand the ‘bogan westy’ accents that flew around the table and were then mixed with beer.<br /><br />

We also got into holiday mode with Holt’s company holiday party festivities which included some beach frisbee, jelly identification, a bus blinder, a photo booth, an after party with handstands and a nose punch (my large nose caught a hand that was demonstrating the force you need to push against the floor for a successful handstand), and finally a Saturday afternoon brewery tour."
  Where are these places and neighborhoods you mention?:
    holt: "I’ve spent the offsites in Australia’s most famous (infamous?) planned city, and then travelled to the beach-just-below-the-most-famous-beach.  We bussed to the third or fourth peninsula east of the CBD, and the after-party was just down the street from our new ‘hood.<br /><br />

Later that weekend, we went to a brewery in a neighborhood so close to the airport that it felt like you could have had planes landing in the street, save for the fact that they’re much larger than any of the streets!  It was a cool small brewery though, loud plane noises notwithstanding.

    kristin: "So you see where we got around to this weekend, this is my map of Eastern Sydney as I know it relationally. Below the harbor, Sydney can somewhat be mapped by the shape of your hand, so I’m using my hand to create the shape of the lower suburbs. <p><a class='lbx' href='images/log_eight/kristin_handmap.jpg'><img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-1478' src='images/log_eight/kristin_handmap.jpg' /></a></p>For reference: My thumb extends out to Watson’s Bay which is the furthest projecting peninsula into the harbor. Down from my thumb is the eastern coastline, where Bondi Beach and Coogee Beach sit. My knuckles create a few of the smaller peninsulas that extend out. My ring finger and my pinky form the CBD (Central Business District) and ‘The Rocks’. <br /><br />

Our apartment is in the neighborhood of Paddington which is bounded by Rushcutter’s Bay to the north and Centennial Park to the south (see ‘Home’ on my hand map). Rushcutter’s is a mooring bay for a few hundred sail boats and yachts. It has a small but grassy little park where a lot of neighborhood locals run with their dogs in the morning. Centennial Park is the largest green space in the city, it’s got a small 6km bike loop, horse trails, ponds, scraggly bush thickets, large open grasses, and architectural follies.<br /><br />

I bused myself down to Coogee Beach which was the base camp for Holt’s company party. Coogee Beach is along the coast and I’ve placed it at about my wrist.<br /><br />

Coogee Beach (see map above), it is about a 3km walk south from Bondi Beach. Less infamous, smaller, and less jaw-droopingly stunning than Bondi, Coogee Beach still has the some of milky tea and rust colored sandstone that tilts trapezodially away from crashing waves and the same azure foamy seawater. <p><a class='lbx' href='images/log_eight/kristin_coogeesandstone.jpg'><img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-1478' src='images/log_eight/kristin_coogeesandstone.jpg' /></a></p>
Wedding Cake Island is a collection of rocks that break the waves somewhat before they get to the beach so Coogee is a ‘protected.’ That protection was little help against the winds on Saturday, because of which the beach was closed for swimming and surfing, meaning lifeguards actively prevented those activities.<br /><br />

The party itself was at Point Piper, the first knuckle of my map.<br /><br />

Holt’s office Monday thru Friday is in the Central Business District (the CBD)."
  What's it like to celebrate Christmas in summer?:
    holt: "It’s a little different, for sure.  The coolest thing related to this I’ve seen is definitely the jet-skiing santa a few weeks ago.  Other than that, it is interesting to see that much of the Christmas-related propaganda is still winter-themed.  Namely posters or flags, things like that.  However, there are also some stores in the CBD that have Christmas windows that are beach themed.  One in particular that I enjoyed involved reindeer fishing on the beach with a cooler of beer, I believe.<br /><br />

I have noticed and appreciated the much lower amount of Christmas carols than you hear in the US.  I’m sure part of it is that I’m not going into stores as much, but still Christmas decorations and carols and the like are definitely much less of a thing, at least in Sydney and Canberra, than in much of the US it seems."
    kristin: "All the Australians have been apologizing for how unseasonably rainy and windy this summer has started. It was chilly on the night of the holiday party, which I rather appreciated.<br /><br />

I didn’t see Santa on the beach, but I’m sure that’s been played out many times down here.<br /><br />

The holiday bike wreath I made was inspired by the tessellated rainbow Christmas banners strung up around town (the tessellated tree is my log 8 cover image)."
  Spot any creatures?:
    holt: "We saw an opossum sitting in a tree looking at us just the other night by our apartment, but other than that, the strange birds and sounds are starting to feel more commonplace.  When I saw that in the tree, it occurred to me that you I don’t see squirrels here ever.  I’m not sure if they’re not here, or they’re just not in our area of Sydney (I didn’t look it up before writing this).  I just remember when I saw the opossum scurrying up the tree out of the corner of my eye, I realized that it wasn’t a squirrel since I never see squirrels, so what was that?  At least I think it was some kind of opossum that I saw…<p><a class='lbx' href='images/log_eight/holt_poss.jpg'><img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-1478' src='images/log_eight/holt_poss.jpg' /></a></p>"
    kristin: "We found a sky blue jelly fish on the beach. I poked at it with a stick, as one does, and used the stick to find knowledgeable Aussies who could identify it for me. Seeing how it was blue everyone immediately said ‘Well, it’s blue like a blue bottle should be, but it’s the wrong shape and the tentacles aren’t long enough.’ <br /><br />

Blue Bottle Jellies are poisonous and are one of the Aussie creatures trying to do you harm, hence why I had the unidentified jelly on a stick. <br /><br />

A child of one of the knowledgeable Aussies ran over and immediately knew it wasn’t super dangerous and ran her hands all up in the tentacles. <br /><br />

No fear."
  Any interesting vocabulary you've noticed in use?:
    holt: "When you boil water, you say you 'bring water to the boil', not to 'a boil'.  I don’t know why, but I think that’s interesting.<br /><br />

I continue to notice and laugh at some of the shortenings of words.  Just the other day I figured that umbrella was too long a word for Aussies to leave unadulterated, and figured that the shortened version must be 'brelli'.  I was close, but it’s actually 'brolli' (pronounced more like 'brulli').  Some Aussies I consulted agreed my version was actually better, but alas, that ship has sailed.<br /><br />

When talking about a motorcycle rider or a motorcycle gang member, they’re often referred to as a 'bikey'.  To me, that doesn’t sound menacing at all, but it’s a loaded term with negative, motorcycle-gang like connotation in Australia which is hard to wrap my head around, since it sounds like it should be referring to a child’s bicycle or something instead."
    kristin: "In order of use in my log:Bogan Westy – A bogan is somebody who is a little country, a little backwater, a little 'white-trash'. A Westy is somebody from the western suburbs (referred to as WS from here on out and not pictured on my hand map as I haven’t explored enough to relationally place them on my hand). The WS are west of something, I don’t know what the 0 line is for separation between E and W. As the WS don’t have the coastal beauty and proximity to the coast that the Eastern suburbs have, the WS were less poplar neighborhoods in which to live. There are educational, wealth, and class stereotypes that are layered on that divide with the East having the upper hand in all of those. There is a lot of endearing superiority when Easty  (somebody from the ES) calls someone ‘bogan westy.’ At least there was in the context in which I heard it used. I will not use this until I can confirm it’s kosher. <br /><br />

Jelly – A jelly fish. <br /><br />

Blinder (in Australian accent, a ‘bliend-Ah’) – a fender bender. The bus blinder mentioned above involved the company bus to the Xmas party bumping into a parked car. The streets were narrow, a roundabout was involved, and the bus driver left a note, so all is well."
  Any additional comments?:
    holt: "It’s interesting how small the city (or maybe country) feels.  I’m sure part of it is that Sydney has lots of beaches, but even so, Coogee on a pretty nice (though bit windy) day, was not crowded at all.  It wasn’t dead, but it wasn’t crowded like I feel the beaches in NY or even Tampa area are on nice days.  I’ve definitely not thought of myself as a beach person in the past though, so not sure I’m qualified to make too many anecdotal claims on that front.<p><a class='lbx' href='images/log_eight/holt_coogeepano.jpg'><img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-1478' src='images/log_eight/holt_coogeepano.jpg' /></a></p>Also on the crowds side, we walked around the biggest park in Sydney, (Centennial park) on an absolutely beautiful Saturday afternoon a couple weekends ago, and while there were people around, it was not even a little bit comparable to what Central Park would be on a day like that.  There’s a bike loop around the middle of the park (about half the length of Central Park’s loop I think) that had cyclists here and there, instead of an unending stream of them like you get in NYC.  Just totally different scale of city.<br /><br />

I also just enjoy the amount of sun.  Being at only 33 degrees latitude, and the fact that it’s spring so the days are getting longer, means lots of sunlight, and it’s actually pretty nice.  I’m without a doubt the most tan I’ve ever been in December."
    kristin: "In NYC, ‘Dan Smith will teach you guitar’ is a thing, and you know exactly who to contact in case you want to learn how to play the guitar. <br /><br />

We got this add for ‘Guitar School’ in our mailbox where it looks like a scared kid will scream at you. Can’t say I want to learn how to play guitar here.<p><a class='lbx' href='images/log_eight/kristin_learnguitar.jpg'><img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-1478' src='images/log_eight/kristin_learnguitar.jpg' /></a></p>"
