desc: Log Five - Holt connects with bartenders and Kristin pretends it's fall.
questions:
  Tell us about your weekend:
    holt: "We had a very nice weekend.  Friday night we went to an 'escape the room' experience in Darling Harbour.  'Escape the Rooms' are popping up everywhere and they are what they are titled, you work with your roommates to escape. It was a bit of an odd experience, but the company (our friends) was good. We then found a cool cocktail bar after our successful escape.<br /><br />
  At the bar, our waiter was totally honest in his intentions, but in a goofy, endearing way.  As-in, saying things like 'you should get that drink because it's more expensive'!  <br /><br />
On Saturday, we went to Kristin's new favorite coffee shop, Bootsdarling, where I had some tasty eggs and avocado (and of course good coffee, two of them I think).  We then went to the Newtown neighborhood, and I got to try a single micro-brew from <i><a href='http://www.younghenrys.com/'>Young Henrys</a></i> brewery (I only got to try one as it was last call when we arrived).  A little late to the social media side of beer, but I finally signed-up for <i><a href='https://untappd.com/user/Hwilkins'>untappd</a></i>, and the Newtowner was my first entry into the app.

We followed the beer with a great dinner at <i><a href='http://hartsyard.com.au/'>Hartsyard</a></i> (beef tartare and smoked pulled pork log) and a huge sundae.<br /><br />
Sunday, we ate brunch on a tiny pier overlooking the incredibly beautiful Sydney bay, then shopped to replace lost luggage all day :(.<br /><br />

    kristin: "We ate a fabulous breakfast at neighborhood café called Bootsdarling. It reminds me somehow of 9th St Espresso back in the East Village [EV].

I don't think we verbally said we were homesick at all to one another, but I tried to capture my version of fall here with a photograph of my feet in fall colored tree droppings and then Holt proposed we walk around the neighborhood of 'Newtown' which we had been told was a bit like Brooklyn.<br /><br />
<p><a class='lbx' href='images/log_five/kristin_fall.jpg'><img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-1478' src='images/log_five/kristin_fall.jpg' /></a></p>From an architectural perspective, the neighborhood is nothing like any BKLYN neighborhood. Of course there aren't the BKLYN brownstones, these are instead all painted stucco Victorian bi-levels, and the layout of the streetscape is different. I've bored Holt with my architectural comparison enough; I'll save you from reading it. <br /><br />What perhaps was like BKLYN was the happenings inside the restaurants and the brewery we visited. Young Henry's Brewery had all the makings of a happenin' BKLYN scene. YH is in a warehouse [BKLYN cool-point acquired], it has skylights [another BKLYN cool-point], a wall of cat art [nailed it again], and Millennials drinking [tre cool]. <br /><br />
<p><a class='lbx' href='images/log_five/kristin_cats.jpg'><img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-1478' src='images/log_five/kristin_cats.jpg' /></a></p>Gastronomically the dinner we shared in this neighborhood was perhaps the tastiest experience of what I think NYC chefs seem to be after. We ate at Hartsyard|Seed and Feed. The food is fantastically flavorful, like wham bam in your mouth, but perfectly roasty with a wonderful balance of spices and delightful combinations."
  Did you cross any new bridges?:
    holt: "We both went to Newtown which was a new part of Sydney for us, and we literally crossed the giant Sydney Harbor bridge, twice.  First in a cab (on the way to brunch) then on foot, and we stopped along the way and did the walking tour up the pylon.  Was a nice view and all, but I don't need to do the tour again, though just walking across the bridge was nice."
    kristin: "Literally. We walked from the North Shore, across the Sydney Harbor Bridge, and through 'The Rocks' and then through the CBD."
  What are the Aussies like?:
    holt: "I've noticed how people in stores and restaurants ask 'what are you up to today', or, if it's later in the day 'what did you get up to today', as opposed to 'how are you' like they would in the US.  I think the question invokes more of a response, and is more inviting, and in general it seems like those who ask it are generally more interested in the answer.  I've also noticed how Aussies ask 'how are you going' as their version of 'how are you doing' that we're used to.  That's if they're not asking about what we got up to, of course."
    kristin: "When we sit down in a bar, an NYC bartender will ask some variation of 'How are you?' which you can answer with one simple word 'Good,' and then examine the menu or your cell phone or appear interested in anything else besides talking to the NYC bartender. <br /><br />The Aussie bartender instead will ask some slanged variation of 'What have you been up to today?' Immediately this is more intriguing as I then recount my day to the bartender, who seems generally interested in how I spent my time. <br /><br />I feel fantastic, as if I've somehow done something today that this bartender wants to hear about. He's not going to tap his fingers impatiently as I make up my mind about whatever cocktail I want, instead, this guy is going to ask what mood I'm in and have a chat before he takes my order and my money. It's a difference that is noticeable, charismatic, and more personable."
  Additional comments?:
    kristin: "I've actively spent a lot of time avoiding spiders and mosquitoes in the apartment. Unfortunately, I can't say I've got nothing to show for it, I've got lots of bites.  I miss the NYC's lack of pesky buggers.<br /><br />I also have a tan line across my forehead from my swim cap – duh!"
    holt: "It's really unfortunate that the buses here are just so unreliable.  The train is quite nice and on time, just doesn't have the same coverage as it does in NYC.  Of course the layout of the city is totally different, but still, it's frustrating that the transit situation isn't as good as NYC."
