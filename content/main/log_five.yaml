  Tell us about your weekend:
    holt: "can't be bothered"
    kristin: "I ate a fabulous breakfast at neighborhood café called Bootsdarling. It reminds me somehow of 9th St Espresso back in the East Village [EV].

I don’t think we verbally said we were homesick at all to one another, but I tried to capture my version of fall here with a photograph of my feet in fall colored tree droppings and then Holt proposed we walk around the neighborhood of ‘Newtown’ which we had been told was a bit like Brooklyn.<br /><br />
<p><a class='lbx' href='images/log_five/kristin_fall.jpg'><img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-1478' src='images/log_five/kristin_fall.jpg' /></a></p>From an architectural perspective, the neighborhood is nothing like any BKLYN neighborhood. Of course there aren’t the BKLYN brownstones, these are instead all painted stucco Victorian bi-levels, and the layout of the streetscape is different. I’ve bored Holt with my architectural comparison enough; I’ll save you from reading it. <br /><br />What perhaps was like BKLYN was the happenings inside the restaurants and the brewery we visited. Young Henry's Brewery had all the makings of a happenin' BKLYN scene. YH is in a warehouse [BKLYN cool-point acquired], it has skylights [another BKLYN cool-point], a wall of cat art [nailed it again], and Millennials drinking [tre cool]. <br /><br />
<p><a class='lbx' href='images/log_five/kristin_cats.jpg'><img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-1478' src='images/log_five/kristin_cats.jpg' /></a></p>Gastronomically the dinner we shared in this neighborhood was perhaps the tastiest experience of what I think NYC chefs seem to be after. We ate at Hartsyard|Seed and Feed. The food is fantastically flavorful, like wham bam in your mouth, but perfectly roasty with a wonderful balance of spices and delightful combinations. "
  Did you cross any new bridges?:

    kristin: "Literally. We walked from the North Shore, across the Sydney Harbor Bridge, and through ‘The Rocks’ and then through the CBD. "
  What are the Aussies like?:
    holt: "can't be bothered"
    kristin: "When we sit down in a bar, an NYC bartender will ask some variation of “How are you?” which you can answer with one simple word “Good,” and then examine the menu or your cell phone or appear interested in anything else besides talking to the NYC bartender. <br /><br />The Aussie bartender instead will ask some slanged variation of “What have you been up to today?” Immediately this is more intriguing as I then recount my day to the bartender, who seems generally interested in how I spent my time. <br /><br />I feel fantastic, as if I’ve somehow done something today that this bartender wants to hear about. He’s not going to tap his fingers impatiently as I make up my mind about whatever cocktail I want, instead, this guy is going to ask what mood I’m in and have a chat before he takes my order and my money. It’s a difference that is noticeable, charismatic, and more personable. "
  Additional comments?:
    kristin: "I’ve actively spent a lot of time avoiding spiders and mosquitoes in the apartment. Unfortunately, I can’t say I’ve got nothing to show for it, I’ve got lots of bites.  I miss the NYC’s lack of pesky buggers.<br /><br />I also have a tan line across my forehead from my swim cap – duh!"
