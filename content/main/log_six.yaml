questions:
  You're celebrating a few things today, tell us about what and with whom you're celebrating.:
    holt: "So, it's both our one-year anniversary and Thanksgiving.  It's almost like it's neither though since in the US (where both things originated) it hasn't been Thanksgiving yet nor would it have been our anniversary yet (because in the US it's the night before still while we're celebrating).  But yeah, celebrating Thanksgiving with some coworkers of mine, and we kinda celebrated our anniversary last night."
    kristin: "Totally true – today we're celebrating our first wedding anniversary as well as Thanksgiving. Since they coincide this year (last year we surprised our parents that we’re visiting us in NYC for Thanksgiving by <i><a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/fashion/weddings/making-an-adventure-of-nontraditional-rites.html?_r=0'>getting married</a></i> the day before T-Day) we’re sharing our anniversary with new friends on the date of the American holiday of Thanksgiving."
  Are you observing Thanksgiving in the traditional manner with parades/Dog Shows/Football/Turkeys/Pumpkin pies?:
    holt: "Traditional in the sense of turkey and stuffing (though maybe those two things aren't traditional in how we've done them), but not so traditional given the company of 4 Americans, a German and an Aussie (the start to a joke somewhere I'm sure).  Also, certainly no football, dog shows or parades.  But we did have pumpkin pie, at least kinda, because it was technically three kinds of squash instead, one was a pumpkin, but none of which were the orange 'traditional' pumpkin.  It was delicious though.

    kristin: "Dog Show – no (does the Shiba Inu win?)<br /><br />
      Football – no (Not too into jai lai, perhaps next year we’ll watch rugby)<br /><br />
      Turkey – Yes! Our turkey is from the meat heaven of <i><a href='http://www.victorchurchill.com/'>Victor Churchill</a></i>.<br /><br />
      Pumpkin pie – Double yes. I've worked hard for this pie, roasting my own pumpkin varietals as canned pumpkin isn't available here. This pie is a thing of beauty.

  Any perspective on observing such an American holiday abroad?:
    holt: "It didn't really feel too foreign or strange to me I guess, no.  Our turkey was in kilos and our oven in celsius, but carving the turkey felt like carving a turkey, and eating the meal and drinking wine was just as tasty."
    kristin: "Thanksgiving in the US is during fall, as such, our recipes are comforting and heavy, stick to your bones sorta foods. T-Day AU style is in the midst of spring, so I made several roasted veggie salads and a panzanella. AU Christmas propaganda relies on the imagery of winter, although it is more the full spectrum of the rainbow, not just red and green. I wonder what notable AU chefs serve for summer Christmas dinner. Why am I roasting a turkey at all during spring? Should I have just seared some scallops?"
  Do you live to eat or eat to live?:
    holt: "Live to eat!  I love eating, yummy yummy!"
    kristin: "Our Bhutanese guide asked us this during dinner one night, as it seemed to be something he was mulling over. He and I got in a politely fierce debate over this question I argued that almost everyone, except perhaps tribes in remote areas live to eat. We flavor things, we savor things, we crave things, all that is a luxury that means we all live to eat. Thanksgiving is a holiday that celebrates living to eat. Besides eating calories for sustenance and literal survival as remote tribes do, I argued almost everybody lives to eat. He believed he eats to live. As he flavored his dinner with extra chilies, I thought something was lost in translation."
  What are you grateful for?:
    holt: "I'm grateful to be married to my lovely wife (she loves being called my wife) and enjoying our life together, wherever we go."
    kristin: "Holt's patience and love."
  What is your favorite memory of this past year?:
    holt: "It would have to be our surprise wedding in front of Lincoln center and the process of being <i><a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/fashion/weddings/making-an-adventure-of-nontraditional-rites.html?_r=0'>printed in the NY Times</a></i> about it.  It was just a great day, and great food, and great to have family there for that and Thanksgiving last year."
    kristin: "This year has been chock-full of so many wonderful things, Holt's proposal to me, our wedding, weekends in the Hudson River Valley, our vacation to Thailand and Bhutan, I can't pick just one."
  What was the hardest moment of last year?:
    holt: "Probably my knee injury in February.  During recovery, feeling totally helpless and not even being able to put on your own socks and shoes is tough."
    kristin: "When Justin came in alone to the ski lodge. I knew Holt was in trouble. Luckily Justin was smirking so I knew the situation was somewhat ironic and not life threatening, but it was the scariest moment of this past year."
