questions:
  You made it! What’s your first reaction?:
    kristin: "It’s bright and warm. Are those purple trees? Yup, those are purple trees."
    holt: "On the plane during the descent my reaction was wow, it’s beautiful.  The seaside cliffs and beaches and just a sprawling yet still somewhat quaint city.  Then our cab driver is very talkative but also very friendly (which an American expat to Australia had told us many people here were, possibly even friendly to a fault).  The apartment is quite lovely as well, in a beautiful neighborhood full of British-style townhouses."
  What did you do upon arriving?:
    kristin: "We immediately went to the home we’ve rented for our year abroad. We're staying in Paddington, which everybody that is familiar with Sydney has said 'Oh, you'll be right in the midst of everything' when we've told them where we would be living."
    holt: "I immediately found the closest coffee shop to the apartment while waiting for the property manager to let us in.  I just left Kristin on the corner of the house with all our luggage while I went to go get coffee.  Priorities."
  Anything particularly different about SYD than from NYC?:
    kristin: "There are trees everywhere and a variety of birds beyond pigeons. And the smells are divine; honeysuckle is in bloom in our SYD neighborhood and although the smells of NYC aren’t particularly displeasing (hype and traveler’s tales would say it smells like urine, but that’s really just not NYC of 2014), although NYC certainly doesn’t have honeysuckle in bloom as you wander down the streets. The smell is delightfully scintillating."
    holt: "The drive from the airport to the apartment was much shorter than I was expecting.  It was probably 20 minutes, so not like the long haul you have to make to get out to JFK from Manhattan.  The Paddington neighborhood feels a bit like Brooklyn, though it was extra quiet when we arrived.  I think the quietness was due to us arriving the morning of a weekday so I guess most people in Paddington had left for work already.  Also, we’d been warned that the city might be quiet (except at bars) that day because it was the day of the Melbourne cup horse race.  At the coffee shop at the end of our street, I felt quite at home.  Even though there’s not really drip coffee here, you can get pretty close with their version of a strong Americano, the 'long black'."
  Did you handle the jet lag well?:
    kristin: "I started getting sleeping immediately after eating dinner, for every spoonful of dinner I ate, my eyelids dropped more. I went to be at 8:30pm. I guess I did all right."
    holt: "Decently.  Didn’t have any falling asleep in the middle of the day episodes, but definitely went to bed early the first couple of nights."
  Additional comments?:
    kristin: "It is bizarre how easy flying makes traveling around the world. Yesterday I was on the beach in front of a bright pink hotel in Florida. Merely +24 hrs and I’m on the other side of the world, starting an entirely new adventure in a foreign country. It’s a little hard to grasp."
    holt: "Too soon to say."
