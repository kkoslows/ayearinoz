questions:
  What did you do today?:
    kristin: "I went for a swim in the Canberra Olympic Pool. A $5.70 day pass bought me entry and use of the locker room. It was a 50m length pool (I have to make the conversion into metric at some point) and I swam in the 'medium' pace lane.<br /><br />
Holt and I also borrowed the hotel single speed bikes again and rode them to the National Portrait Gallery."
    holt: "Borrowed the bike again, this time we rode to the National Portrait Gallery."
  Describe an interesting creature or human you saw.:
    kristin: "At the 'In the Flesh' exhibit at the National Portrait Gallery, artist Sam Jink molds human figures in silicon with unnerving detail. The silicon flesh has the same luminescence as human skin and the artist painstakingly inserts hairs in all the right places, like knuckles and arms, and the one that pops out of a mole. <br /><br />
One of the more striking pieces he created was of a man hanging, obviously he relied on the Christ on a cross reference for the gravitas of that piece, but the way the body sagged with whatever was on that character's mind was intense. There was also an interesting study of a man and woman, each in the fetal position facing one another, but they each had fox heads instead of human heads. Not sure why, but it made me smile since our dog looks like a fox and I miss our dog terribly. The scale of this study was small and each figure had accurate but tiny little toes. It was somehow sweet to see the fox-couple curled up next to one another.

"
    holt: "Saw lots of creepily realistic looking art at the gallery.  I guess it was silicon molded to look like humans, but the details were so precise as to the veins in the arms, creases in arms or fingers, and of course the real human hair everywhere it should be."
  Any divine food or beverage experiences today?:
    kristin: "Monster chocolate chip cookie. Yeah, I did it. It was glorious."
    holt: "Not necessarily divine, but for my second coffee of the day, I went to a stand with some coworkers called 2 past 10.  The stand also sold little sandwiches, but as is appropriate for Australia, about 75% of the coffee stand was dedicated to housing the grinder and machine (just the general coffee operation), leaving the remainder as the kitchen for making said sandwiches.  The coffee was great (I had a long black)."
  What slang or Australian vocabulary did you hear today?:
    kristin: "I don't pickup on weird things Aussies say, Holt has to point it out to me"
    holt: "Bread pudding is apparently called bread & butter pudding here.  Also, not really slang, but I had a trout hash brown at breakfast (called breaky here), and I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was what it sounds like.  It was a hash brown with bits of trout inside it, and quite tasty."
  Additional comments?:
    kristin: "I switched all of my fitness tracking programs over to metric. Pool lengths, and running distances are now all in meters and kilometers. I even went so far to change to Celsius. Total immersion. I'm sticking to Holt's mantra '16 is 60' to learn that 16 degrees Celsius is 60 degrees F.  I hope its about 16 degrees often, otherwise I'll have no idea what temperature it is."
    holt: "No."
