questions:
  Where are you in AU?:
    kristin: "Canberra, the capitol of AU. We’re staying at ‘Hotel Hotel’ which is a place for ‘people people.’ It’s a terribly trendy hotel, which I didn’t know would be available to me in Canberra."
    holt: "Canberra, the capitol."
  What did you do today?:
    kristin: "Holt and I took a long bike ride around Lake Burley Griffin. It was a 16km loop around the lake that we did on single speed bikes.<br />I also took a sketching class of a live nude model at the hotel that was directed by the Nishi Art Gallery. As an architect, you need to be able to communicate your ideas through sketching and that is a skill that I’ve let decline as I’ve relied on the computer to draft. We began doing several 10-minute sketches as the model moved through various poses. We finished the class working on a longer, 45-minute sketch. It was a great challenge and I’m going to make an effort to sketch my year abroad to get better at hand drawing."
    holt: "Went to work, borrowed a little single-speed bike from the hotel to both get to and from work on as well as do a 16km ride around the western part of the lake in Canberra.<p><a class='lbx' href='images/log_three/Holt_LBG.jpg'><img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-1478' src='images/log_three/Holt_LBG.jpg' /></a></p>"
  Describe an interesting creature or human you saw.:
    kristin: "There is a sort of pigeon-like looking bird that I saw on my bike ride. It has a pink band of feathers around its neck and a grey body. Holt has named it a ‘pidgey-poo’."
    holt: "These weird birds that looked like they had pink sweaters around their necks covering the lower par of their mouths.  I guess sorta hipster birds or something."
  Any divine food or beverage experiences today?:
    kristin: "I’ve come down with a cold, so although the food looks absolutely stunning, I can’t taste anything and I don't have much of an appetite."
    holt: "Mandarin soufflé and chocolate sorbet paired with a Spanish port at the hotel was fantastic.  Also, the coffee so far is good everywhere in Australia.

  Any thoughts about the Aussie lifestyle you’d like to share?:
    kristin: "Everyone seems quite happy to wait for the crosswalk symbol and sometimes that wait is very long. Yet, they don’t jaywalk."
    holt: "Coffee!  It’s a big part of the culture here and I love it.  Also, at least in Canberra, I’ve noticed that people wait at the lights a lot more than in NYC (both pedestrians and cyclists)."
  Additional comments?:
    kristin: "I hate being sick and wish I could happily devour the breakfast pastry setup they display in the lobby. It looks like a pastry carnival."
    holt: "My allergies seem slightly more upset in Canberra..."
