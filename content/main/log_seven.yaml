    kristin: "I snooped around the suburb of Alexandria as I was meeting someone in that neighborhood for lunch. I cemented myself at <i><a href='http://groundsroasters.com/'>'The Grounds'</a></i>, a coffee roaster cum eatery/retailer/bakery/rustic garden with generous outdoor seating with a potting shed and pig named 'Kevin Bacon.' It's got a lot going on.

In the evening we went to the Sydney Opera House to see the play entitled 'Switzerland'."
  Did you enjoy the Sydney Opera House?:
    holt: "I enjoy the building from the outside, the large windows pointing out on the harbor and the sort of shark-fins out on the end of the peninsula. Being inside it didn't feel all that different from a normal place, but probably because the play venue was underground."
    kristin: "We've remotely glimpsed the Opera House aerially from Holt's office, and at sea level from the harbor ferry, but I thought I would get to spend quality in-detail time investigating the surfaces, the structure, and the processional experience by seeing a play housed within. <p><a class='lbx' href='images/log_seven/kristin_operahouseviews.jpg'><img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-1478' src='images/log_seven/kristin_operahouseviews.jpg' /></a></p>
However, the play was located in a small theatre sunk into the level of the red-masonry podium instead of the iconic white concrete sails. <br /><br />
As we were pressed for time to make curtain call, we simply slipped through the base and into the theatre, I had almost no sense of place or being within the Opera House at all."
  How about Switzerland, the play you watched?:
    holt: "I did. It was just a two-person act, there was no intermission, but it wasn't long enough that if felt like it needed one. I thought the length was good, the play was engaging, and it just kept getting more and more engaging throughout. Great Switzerland-type home set as well. The Eames chair in the corner was a great touch."
    kristin: "It was enjoyable, it was about the creative process of fictional writing and is an account of an extreme process that might be needed for an author to be creative enough to craft a truly engrossing text-based world."
  Any comments about the play as it was within the Opera House?:
    holt: "Not especially. I guess the fact that it was in the Opera House didn't seem either a positive or a negative. It was however, a very nice small, intimate venue for the play (as I understand it there are several halls in the complex), so I very much enjoyed the space the play was in, but mostly because it was small and we had nice seats, not because it was showing at the OPERA HOUSE."
    kristin: "The author collects weaponry instead of paintings as she believes the engineering in such weaponry to be more masterful artworks than paintings on a canvas. I thought this comment was well housed with the venue as the architectural and engineering feats that went into the Opera House building design/construction were before its time. <br /><br />
I also agree with the statement, architecture/engineering is formative and performative. Paintings don't perform, they sit on display. They can't be inhabited in the human-scale sense of the way, so yeah, works of architecture and engineering are more masterful."
  Any additional comments?:
    holt: "The past weekend we went camping and sailing. I learned that while wallabies are incredibly cute, they're just basically rodents on the campsite. <a class='lbx' href='images/log_seven/holt_wallabie.jpg'><img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-1478' src='images/log_seven/holt_wallabie.jpg' /></a>
In the spirit of Thanksgiving, Kristin attempted make friends with a wallaby by offering it a beer.

Sailing was a blast, we went from the basin in Pittwater Bay up to Lobster Beach.

    kristin: "Last weekend we camped at Ku-Ring-Gai-Chase National Park (about an hour north of Sydney) and we took a short yet steep hike to see a series of aboriginal engravings. The Aboriginals had a wonderful way of figure drawing in which they would stand in the sun and stretch out like a star, then travel their star-figure shadow. Here is my own star-shadow at 11:30am in the Sydney sun.

<br /><br />
At Thanksgiving, we had a conversation about dangerous Australian creatures and the lone Aussie at the table commented that AU kiddies are bred tough. <br /><br />
The campsite was inhabited by droves of wallabies and while wallabies aren't the size of kangaroos they are still large enough to wallop you. While I carefully approached one of them, a little girl, probably age 5 chased one around a tree to protect her pink air mattress and snackies. I don't know if 5 year old me would have bounded after a wallaby, but this kid sure did."
