Why are you in Australia?:
  kristin: "Why not? We were asked if we wanted to live abroad and it's always been a dream of mine to do so. I had mostly always wished for that opportunity so I could fluently learn a language, but this is still a super cool way to spend a year. So seriously, Why not?"
  holt: "First and foremost I'm here for work.  We needed someone of my role to be in the Asia-Pacific area to cover this part of the world time-wise.  I'll be supporting people remotely still, but at least finding overlapping time will be much easier.  I took the offer to move out here because it seemed like a fun opportunity and one not to reject.  I knew an embarrassingly little amount about Australia before accepting and deciding to move here for awhile, but where's the fun in deciding to move somewhere you've been before?"
Why are you answering these questions?:
  kristin: "I wanted a way to share my experiences with friends and family back home and thought a log would be direct link to everyone. I'm also really interested to read Holt's account of our days. We often notice very different things about a shared experience and it will be interesting to read his descriptions."
  holt: "It seems like a good log of a way to remember my initial experiences, both as a log for others and equally, if not more, as a log for me.  I've sometimes wished I'd had logs of certain things so I could remember my perspective again, so maybe this will do that, even if only for a little while"
What do you hope to see or experience while in AU?:
  kristin: "Anything and everything"
  holt: "As I said in the earlier question, I came in with very few preconceptions, positive or negative.  I knew about diving, spiders and the outback, and that's about it.  So, ready to experience whatever's actually there."
Anything you think youâ€™ll miss about NYC?:
  kristin: "Friends asked us this on the way out of the city. I had answered then that because there is so much in NYC, its hard to have favorites that you visit over and over. Part of the NYC game is to try new things, know the hottest new restaurant before everyone else, eat there and have it be amazing, and then tell everyone else about your 'find' that has already been reviewed by the Times. I couldn't give our friends a specific answer. Having been in SYD for a bit now, I'd say what I miss the most at this early stage is the East Village, the density of diversity of NYC, the comfort of having habits, and the lifestyle of weekend brunching."
  holt: "Sydney doesn't have citibike, so I figure I'll miss having that convenience, and I'll miss my friends and our frequent dinners out and/or bar nights.  I may also miss some of my stand-by eating spots in NYC as well.  I'm really worried about missing beer too.  That's one preconception I do have, that Australia doesn't have too much in the way of micro-brews.  I figure I'll be finding the ones there are, but also gaining a deeper appreciation of Australian wine to supplement :)"
Any hesitations or worries about living abroad for a year?:
  kristin: "That my gap-year won't be framed positively in my resume - i.e. might this be a career sidetrack or all together pause?"
  holt: "Some of the logistics made me worried, like what happens with my bank accounts, and taxes, and cell phone, and will anything be the same again?!  But, none of those things are too big of a deal, and I know everything will be sorted out in the end"
Any nerves about sharing your experiences with others so openly?:
  kristin: "Of course, I'd much rather be a closed book that occasionally sprouts witty banter that you think I've been internally dialoguing all the while. Instead, I'll have to share in a quantity that will probably reveal I've been faking wit the entire time."
  holt: "I figure I wouldn't put something here that I wouldn't tell someone if they asked, so I guess not really.  I also don't really think that this will be read by people I don't already know, but I guess we'll see."
