Why are you in Australia?:
  kristin: "Why not? We were asked if we wanted to live abroad and it's always been a dream of mine to do so. I had mostly always wished for that opportunity so I could fluently learn a language, but this is still a super cool way to spend a year. So seriously, Why not?"
  holt: "Yeah, me too.  I can't be bothered at the moment."
Why are you answering these questions?:
  kristin: "I wanted a way to share my experiences with friends and family back home and thought a log would be direct link to everyone. I'm also really interested to read Holt's account of our days. We often notice very different things about a shared experience and it will be interesting to read his descriptions."
  holt: "Yeah, me too.  I can't be bothered at the moment."
What do you hope to see or experience while in AU?:
  kristin: "Anything and everything"
  holt: "Yeah, me too.  I can't be bothered at the moment."
Anything you think youâ€™ll miss about NYC?:
  kristin: "Friends asked us this on the way out of the city. I had answered then that because there is so much in NYC, its hard to have favorites that you visit over and over. Part of the NYC game is to try new things, know the hottest new restaurant before everyone else, eat there and have it be amazing, and then tell everyone else about your 'find' that has already been reviewed by the Times. I couldn't give our friends a specific answer. Having been in SYD for a bit now, I'd say what I miss the most at this early stage is the East Village, the density of diversity of NYC, the comfort of having habits, and the lifestyle of weekend brunching."
  holt: "Yeah, me too.  I can't be bothered at the moment."
Any hesitations or worries about living abroad for a year?:
  kristin: "That my gap-year won't be framed positively in my resume - i.e. might this be a career sidetrack or all together pause?"
  holt: "Yeah, me too.  I can't be bothered at the moment."
Any nerves about sharing your experiences with others so openly?:
  kristin: "Of course, I'd much rather be a closed book that occasionally sprouts witty banter that you think I've been internally dialoging all the while. Instead, I'll have to share in a quantity that will probably reveal I've been faking the wit the entire time."
  holt: "Yeah, me too.  I can't be bothered at the moment."
