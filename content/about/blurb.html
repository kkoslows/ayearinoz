<h1>Every 7 years you change.</h1>
<p>Most of the cells in your body are renewed every 7 years. Perhaps your need a life change to fully reinvigorate those cells. Perhaps you just need a change to more fully appreciate your family and friends.</p>
<p>Life in New York City can be weary and repetitive, fully of stress and commitments. Kristin is afraid of settling into a pattern too easily and too early in life. A wannabe traveler, taster of all foods, and architecture student of the world's greatest buildings, she wanted to venture out on the road and explore.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s been said that every 7 years you go through a period of change. In an attempt to explore and renew those changing cells, Holt and Kristin will spend a year abroad in Australia. Can they help each other, or will they want return to the comforts of their previous NYC home? Will they survive the snakes and spiders? What if they decide to stay in OZ?</p>
