<h1>Every 7 years you change.</h1>

<p>Most of the cells in your body are renewed every 7 years. Perhaps your need a life change to fully reinvigorate those cells. Perhaps you just need a change to more fully appreciate your family and friends.</p>

<p>Life in New York City can be wonderfully fast, full of ever changing exhibits, streetscapes, and juxtapositions. It can also be tiresome to keep up with those changes, and as such, we can develop into habits to easily. Kristin is afraid of settling into those patterns too easily and too early in life. A wannabe architectural traveler, she wanted to venture out on the road and explore. Holt is just hoping to do something interesting.  That's pretty meta.</p>

<p>It has been said that every 7 years you go through a period of change. In an attempt to explore and renew those changing cells, Holt and Kristin will spend a year abroad in Australia. Can they help each other, or will they want return to the comforts of their previous NYC home? Will they survive the snakes and spiders?</p>

<p>What if they decide to stay in OZ?</p>
